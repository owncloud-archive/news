Bugs
----
Before reporting bugs:

* We do not support Internet Explorer and Safari (Patches accepted though, except for IE < 10)
* get the newest version of the App Framework
* get the newest version of the News app
* `check if they have already been reported <https://github.com/owncloud/news/issues?state=open>`_


Before you install the News app
-------------------------------
Before you install the app check that the following requirements are met:

- `Magic quotes are turned off <http://php.net/manual/de/security.magicquotes.disabling.php>`_ (only needed for PHP < 5.4)
- `You use a browser that supports the FileReader API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/FileReader#Browser_compatibility>`_
- You can use a cron or webcron to call Background Jobs in ownCloud
- You have installed **php-curl** and activated it in the **php.ini**
- Install ownCloud **5.0.5** (important! comes with required CSS styles)

Should you have upgraded from a prior version, disable the CSS and JavaScript caching by adding this to :file:`owncloud/config/config.php`::

    DEFINE('DEBUG', true);

You can remove the line after a page reload


App Store
---------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Go to the ownCloud apps page
- Activate the **App Framework** App first, then activate the **News** app in the apps menu
- `Set up ownCloud Background Jobs <http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/admin_manual/configuration/background_jobs.html>`_ to enable feed updates. A recommended timespan for feed updates is 15-30 Minutes.

Keep up to date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simply disable and reenable the **News** and **App Framework** App again (ownCloud deletes the app if its not shipped by default)

Git (development version)
-------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Clone the **App Framework** app into the **/var/www** directory::

	git clone https://github.com/owncloud/appframework.git

- Clone the **News** app into the **/var/www** directory::

	git clone https://github.com/owncloud/news.git


- Link both into ownCloud's apps folder::

	ln -s /var/www/appframework /var/www/owncloud/apps
	ln -s /var/www/news /var/www/owncloud/apps

- Activate the **App Framework** App first, then activate the **News** app in the apps menu

- `Set up ownCloud Background Jobs <http://doc.owncloud.org/server/5.0/admin_manual/configuration/background_jobs.html>`_ to enable feed updates. A recommended timespan for feed updates is 15-30 Minutes.

Keep up to date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the newest update you can use git. To update the appframework use::

    cd /var/www/appframework
    git pull --rebase origin master


To update the News app use::

    cd /var/www/news

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------
* **Next item**: n / j / right arrow
* **Previous item**: p / k / left arrow
* **Star current item**: s / i
* **Keep current item unread**: u

Performance Notices
-------------------
* It is currently discouraged to use it in large hosted installations since there is no way to restrict the backgroundjob to require a pause of X minutes. This `will be addressed <https://github.com/owncloud/news/issues/103>`_ in the `next ownCloud release <https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/3051>`_.
* Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for better database performance

Configuration
-------------
This will be in a seperate config file in the future but for now you can tweak the folowing things. 

:file:`dependencyinjection/dicontainer.php`

* To cache feeds longer increase::
 
    $this['simplePieCacheDuration'] = 30*60;  // seconds

* To let people have more read items per feed before they are purged increase::

    $this['autoPurgeCount'] = 200;  // per feed

:file:`js/app/app.coffee`

All changes in the coffee file have to be compiled by using::

    make

in the **js/** directory

* To increase the interval when the app fetches new entries from database(!, not the webpage, thats set by the backgroundjob interval) change::

    feedUpdateInterval: 1000*60*3  # miliseconds
